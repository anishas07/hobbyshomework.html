        <p> One of my hobbies are running. I personally enjoy running because it's really fun to run and it is really good for your
        mental and physical health in general. Whenever I start running I like to escape reality. Running keeps you fit and at
        the same time eat it actually is really good for your well-being and mental health so I would recommend you doing it as
        well.</p></div>
      
<code> LISTENING TO MUSIC</code>
